## Phase Details

### Phase 11: Backend Validation & Propagation
**Goal**: The backend correctly enforces that only date, description, and category are editable on linked transactions, and propagates those changes using existing diff-based logic
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone; builds on existing service layer)
**Requirements**: VAL-01, VAL-02, PROP-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. A PUT request to update amount, account, type, recurrence, or split settings on a linked transaction returns an error
  2. A PUT request to update date, description, or category on a linked transaction succeeds
  3. When a linked transaction's date is updated with propagation=all, all installments in the series shift by the same diff applied via existing logic
  4. When propagation=current_and_future is used, only the current and future installments shift; past installments are unaffected
  5. No new propagation logic is introduced — the existing date diff mechanism is reused for all three propagation modes
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 12: Frontend Edit Form
**Goal**: Users editing a linked transaction see only the fields they can change, with non-editable fields clearly disabled and the propagation drawer available when recurrences exist
**Depends on**: Phase 11
**Requirements**: FE-01, FE-02, FE-03, FE-04, FE-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. When opening the edit form for a linked transaction, amount and account fields are visible but disabled and cannot be interacted with
  2. The transaction type selector is not rendered when editing a linked transaction
  3. The recurrence toggle and its associated inputs are not rendered when editing a linked transaction
  4. The split settings section is not rendered when editing a linked transaction
  5. When editing a linked transaction that belongs to a recurring series, the propagation settings drawer appears and the user can select all/current/current_and_future before saving
**Plans**: TBD
**UI hint**: yes

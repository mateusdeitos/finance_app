## Current Position

Phase: 08
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 08
Last activity: 2026-04-16

Progress: ███████░░░ 75% (3/4 phases complete)

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-16)

**Core value:** Partners can accurately track shared finances, including in-progress installment purchases, without losing history or requiring manual workarounds.
**Current focus:** Phase 08 — Frontend

## Performance Metrics

- v1.0: 4 phases, 8 plans, 1 day (2026-04-09 → 2026-04-10)
- v1.1: 4 phases planned, 3 complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- v1.0 Recurrence Redesign shipped 2026-04-10. 4 phases, 8 plans completed. Archived: `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
- Charge entity uses `payer_user_id` / `charger_user_id` (explicit directional fields, not connection orientation) — no SwapIfNeeded needed for ownership checks
- Accept flow uses `transactionRepo.Create` directly (NOT transactionService.Create) to avoid nested DB transactions
- Race condition guard: conditional UPDATE `WHERE status='pending'` + affected-rows check (not SELECT FOR UPDATE) — cleaner, no read-check-write window
- `charges` table uses ON DELETE RESTRICT on connection_id — connection cannot be deleted while pending charges exist
- `transactions.charge_id` is nullable FK — set on auto-created transfers, null on all manually created transactions
- Phase 8 (Frontend) uses non-optimistic mutation pattern — no optimistic updates for financial state transitions
- Import cycle fix: moved `ImportDecimalSeparatorValue`/`ImportTypeDefinitionRule` to `domain/transaction_import.go` — mockery v2 generates mock_TransactionService with a service import, causing a cycle; domain is the correct home
- [Phase 07]: Mock-based handler tests (Path A) used for charge handler — no existing handler test files in repo
- [Phase 07]: HandleServiceError returns *echo.HTTPError for no-tag errors (Forbidden/AlreadyExists); *TaggedHTTPError for tag-bearing validation errors

### Critical pitfalls noted (see .planning/research/PITFALLS.md)

- CP-1: Double-accept race condition — use conditional UPDATE with affected-rows check
- CP-2: Non-atomic accept — single DB transaction for status update + both transfers
- DI-2: Transfer pair symmetry — use existing linked-transaction mechanism (single cross-user transfer, not two separate creates)
- FE-1: Badge staleness — invalidate QueryKeys.Charges in all charge mutation hooks

### Todos

- Run integration tests with Docker when available (4 UAT items blocked)

### Blockers

None
